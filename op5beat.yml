op5beat:
  # How often to query livestatus for data. The default is 30s.
  period: 30s

  # When Querying livestatus, how fresh should the last check be? The default is 30

  lastCheck: 30

  # The host and port where livestatus is listening.
  op5Host: "/opt/monitor/var/rw/live"

  # The connection type to use for livestatus (unix or tcp)

  columns: ["host_name", "display_name", "state", "plugin_output", "long_plugin_output", "percent_state_change", "perf_data"]
  
  # (Optional) An array of filters to apply to the query.
  # By default a query must pass all filters, but 'And: x' or 'Or: x' commands can be used,
  # where x specifies the number of previous filter lines to apply the operator to.
  # Ex. ["state = 1", "state = 3", "Or: 2" ] matches anything with a state of 1 OR 3.
  #filter: ["checks_enabled = 1", "host_state = 0"]

  # Whether or not to split up the perfdata into individual metrics. This will create additional fields such as
  # [cpu][value], [cpu][min], [cpu][max], etc. for each parameter in the performance data. Default is true.
  #metrics: true

  # If enabled, only perfdata for the specified services will be reported. Default is to include metrics for all services.
  #metrics_allow: ["CPU Utilization", "Disk IO", "Memory", "Interface"]
  
  # If enabled, perfdata for the specified services will not be reported. Default is to include metrics for all services.
  #metrics_block: ["Uptime", "System Time", "Check_MK", "Log"]
  
  # Whether to report just the 'value' field of the perfdata metrics, or whether to include the min / max / warn / crit
  # fields as well. Default is true.
  #metrics_value_only: true
  
#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================= Paths ======================================
path:
  # The home path for the op5beat installation. This is the default base path
  # for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
  # distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
  # If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
  # home path is the location of the binary.
  home: /usr/share/op5beat

  # The configuration path for the op5beat installation. This is the default
  # base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
  # and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
  # configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
  config: /etc/op5beat

  # The data path for the op5beat installation. This is the default base path
  # for all the files in which op5beat needs to store its data. If not set by a
  # CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
  # subdirectory inside the home path.
  data: /var/lib/op5beat

  # The logs path for a op5beat installation. This is the default location for
  # the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
  # the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
  logs: /var/log/op5beat

#================================ Logging =====================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.
logging:
  # Sets log level. The default log level is info.
  # Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
  level: info

  # Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
  # Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
  # Multiple selectors can be chained.
  #selectors: [ ]

  # Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
  to_syslog: false

  # If enabled, op5beat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
  # in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
  # the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
  # all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
  metrics.enabled: false

  # The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
  #logging.metrics.period: 30s

  # Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
  # files.
  to_files: true
  files:
    # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
    # under the home path (the binary location).
    path: /var/log/op5beat

    # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
    name: op5beat.log

    # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
    # automatically rotated
    rotateeverybytes: 10485760

    # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
    keepfiles: 4
